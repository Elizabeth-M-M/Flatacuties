### About the program
This is a mini web app to practice on array iteration, DOM, Events and Server communications.

### Set up
#### HTML
- The `index.html` structure was built out using HTML setting everything inside a `section` tag.

#### CSS
- Using `style.css`, I built out the design and layout of the HTML elements.

#### JavaScript
- Using `script`, I built out the functionality of the app.


#### Live server
- Using `db.json`, I had a live server accesing my object data needed for my app functionality.
